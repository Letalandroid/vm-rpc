# Getting Player to Work
**Only works with Player 14 and 15.**
1. Download the [VIX API](https://my.vmware.com/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/12_0|PLAYER-1259|drivers_tools).
2. Install it.
3. Open the installation folder in Windows Explorer.
4. Download [the Workstation 15 files to update VIX](https://github.com/dhinakg/vm-rpc/releases/download/vmware-vix/VMware.VIX.zip), and extract to where you installed VIX, making sure to overwrite anything.
5. Download [`vixwrapper-config.txt`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhinakg/vm-rpc/master/vixwrapper-config.txt) and replace the existing one with the downloaded one.
6. `vmrun` should work now. [Go back to README.md.](https://github.com/dhinakg/vm-rpc)
