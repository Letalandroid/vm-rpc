# Getting Player to Work
**Only works with Player 15. Player 14 coming soon when I have the files.**
1. Download the [VIX API](https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/free#desktop_end_user_computing/vmware_workstation_player/14_0%7CPLAYER-1415%7Cdrivers_tools).
2. Install it.
3. Download [the Workstation 15 files to update VIX](https://github.com/dhinakg/vm-rpc/releases/tag/vmware-vix), and extract to where you installed VIX.
4. `vmrun` should work now. [Go back to README.md.](https://github.com/dhinakg/vm-rpc)
